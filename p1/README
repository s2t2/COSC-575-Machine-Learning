COSC-575 Starter Files for p1

This archive contains source files with method stubs and various data
files in Mark's file format.

You can use any platform for development, but your project must compile
on cs-class using the command from within this directory:

$ java *.java

When you're ready to upload to Autolab, create the zip file for submission
by typing:

$ zip submit.zip *.java HONOR

You can submit to Autolab four times.  You can perform two compile checks,
and you can perform two project submissions that will be automatically
graded.
